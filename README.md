# QR Alarm

Android application that requires users to scan QR codes to turn off their alarms.

The ideal use of this application is to download the generated QR code and print it off. You then place it somewhere on your wall away from where you sleep so that when the alarm triggers in the morning, you have no choice but to get out of bed.
